This repository contains a statistical analysis of COVID-19 trends and vaccine efficacy using [Chicago Department of Public Health](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/COVID-19-Daily-Rolling-Average-Case-Death-and-Hosp/e68t-c7fv) data:

### Key Findings
* Covid deaths are varied over time, characterized by major spikes

* 41% of covid deaths were Black, 32% were Latinx

* 79% of covid deaths were 60 years old or older

* Although vaccine deployment was done in phases, the initial introduction of the vaccine to healthcare workers was most strongly correlated with reducing covid death rates among vulnerable populations

* The first phase of the vaccine deployment resulted in 1.2 fewer covid deaths on per day among Black Chicagoans, and 2 fewer for Latinx Chicagoans, and 3.16 fewer for people 60 and older
